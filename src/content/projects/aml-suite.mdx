## 🔎 Overview

**Menarguez-IA AML Suite** is an integrated toolkit to support **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) investigations**.

With a single Bash launcher, the environment:

- ✅ Verifies critical paths and dependencies.  
- 🚀 Starts a **FastAPI** backend with a documented Swagger API.  
- 📊 Launches a **Streamlit** dashboard for real-time risk monitoring.  
- 🧩 Connects to local data processing tools such as `main_sql.py` and forensic scripts.

The goal is to simulate a compact **AML investigation platform** that centralizes scripts, dashboards and APIs in one place.

## 👨‍💻 Role

In this project I was responsible for:

- 🧱 Designing the overall architecture of the suite (launcher, backend, dashboard, scripts).  
- 💻 Implementing the Bash orchestration logic.  
- 🐍 Developing and integrating the Python components (FastAPI, Streamlit, SQL tooling).  
- 🧪 Testing the suite in a local AML lab scenario and refining the workflow.  

---

## ❓ Problem

AML investigations often require:

- Working with **multiple disconnected tools** (scripts, dashboards, APIs).  
- Repeating manual steps to launch environments and load data.  
- Keeping track of logs, paths and states when something fails.

This increases friction for analysts and makes it harder to:

- Reproduce investigations.  
- Share a consistent workflow with other team members.  
- Extend the toolkit over time.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a suite that:

- 🔘 Starts with **one single command** (`bash lanzar_suite_aml.sh`).  
- 🧩 Groups together backend, dashboards and helper scripts.  
- 🧠 Makes it easier to run AML experiments and investigations in a repeatable way.  
- 📈 Provides dashboards and endpoints that could later be integrated into bigger systems.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The suite is composed of several scripts and components:

- **`lanzar_suite_aml.sh`**  
  - Main launcher that verifies the environment, checks critical paths and starts all services.

- **`verificador_ruta.sh`**  
  - Helper script that validates folders and scripts before execution to avoid runtime errors.

- **`main_sql.py`**  
  - Handles SQL queries and data preparation for AML analysis (transactions, alerts, KPIs).

- **`aml_dashboard.py`**  
  - Main **Streamlit** dashboard for analysts, showing:
    - Key risk indicators.  
    - Top accounts with more alerts.  
    - Suspicious transactions and patterns.

- **`aml_dashboard_old.py`**  
  - Previous version of the dashboard, kept for reference and comparison during refactors.

- **`forensis.py`**  
  - Forensic toolkit to perform deeper investigations and export additional evidence.

All components are coordinated so that a single command:

```bash
bash lanzar_suite_aml.sh
