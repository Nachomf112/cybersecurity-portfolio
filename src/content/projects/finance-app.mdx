## 🔎 Overview

**Menarguez-IA · PWA Starter** is a **Progressive Web App (PWA) template** created for **Menarguez-IA Solutions**.  
It is a lightweight HTML-based starter configured to be deployed easily on **Vercel** and installed as a small web app on any device.

The main idea is to have a **small, reusable base** that I can quickly adapt for IA tools, internal dashboards and landing pages.

---

## 👨‍💻 Role

I was responsible for the entire lifecycle of the project:

- 🧱 Designing the PWA structure.  
- ⚙️ Configuring the service worker and the web app manifest.  
- 🚀 Preparing the deployment on Vercel.  
- 📝 Documenting the template so it can be reused in future projects.

---

## ❓ Problem

Every time I wanted to publish a **small tool or prototype**, I had to:

- Start from scratch with HTML / assets.  
- Reconfigure basic PWA pieces (manifest, service worker).  
- Rebuild the deployment workflow.

This slowed down experimentation and made it harder to ship quick IA demos or internal utilities for Menarguez-IA.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create a **starter template** that:

- Uses only **HTML + a minimal Service Worker**.  
- Can be deployed to **Vercel** in just a few clicks.  
- Works as the foundation for future **Menarguez-IA micro-apps and dashboards**.  
- Is simple enough to customize in minutes.

---

## ✨ Solution

The final solution is a small but flexible **PWA skeleton**:

- 📄 Static HTML layout ready to be extended with JavaScript or any front-end framework.  
- 🧩 A configured **`service-worker.js`** to handle basic caching and offline support.  
- ☁️ A simple **Vercel** setup that uses the `public` folder as the output directory.  
- 🧱 A clean file structure so new pages or scripts can be added without breaking the setup.

This allows me to focus on the **logic and UI** of each new idea instead of rebuilding the base every time.

---

## 🧪 User Testing

I tested the starter in different scenarios:

- 📱 Installation as a PWA on desktop and mobile.  
- 🌐 Behaviour with slow or unstable connections.  
- 🔁 Rapid iterations using Vercel preview deployments.

These tests helped validate that:

- The PWA installs correctly on supported devices.  
- Updates are delivered without confusing the user.  
- The template behaves consistently across environments.

---

## ⚙️ Challenges and Learnings

- 📦 **Caching rules**: tuning the service worker so assets are cached, but updates still arrive when needed.  
- 🗂️ Understanding how Vercel serves static assets from the `public` directory.  
- 🧰 Keeping the starter **minimal** but flexible enough to support future features (extra pages, scripts, or frameworks on top).

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This PWA starter is now my **go-to base project** for small IA experiments and internal tools at **Menarguez-IA Solutions**.  

It lets me:

- 🚀 Launch prototypes quickly.  
- 🧪 Test ideas without fighting with configuration.  
- 🔁 Reuse the same structure for multiple apps, keeping deployment and PWA setup already solved.
