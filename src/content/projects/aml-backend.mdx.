## Overview

This project is a backend/API designed to support **Menarguez-IA Solutions**.
The goal is to provide endpoints for security and AML-related automations,
storing data and exposing it in a clean and secure way.

## Main features

- REST-style endpoints for core functionalities.
- Separation between configuration, routes and business logic.
- Basic validation and error handling.
- Ready to be deployed on a cloud provider or containerized.

## Tech stack

- **Node.js / JavaScript** (or el lenguaje real que uses).
- **GitHub** for version control.
- Designed to integrate with frontend dashboards or automation scripts.

## What I learned

- How to structure a small backend/API project.
- How to think in terms of endpoints and data flows.
- How to prepare a security-focused project ready for future extensions.
